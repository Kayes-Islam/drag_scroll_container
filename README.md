## Disclaimer 
All code for DragScrollContainer has been generated by [GPT Engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer). This project was part of my experimentation and hands-on for using GPT Engineer. Using the prompt I was able to generate all the code for DragScrollContainer and partially code for ./example/lib/main.dart. I had to make very small changes to DragScrollContainer code to make it compile, then changed main.dart file fo example to my needs.


## Usage

Supply the ScrollController and a child. Ie n the example below we are passing in the same ScrollController used by the ListView:
```
DragScrollContainer(
  scrollController: scrollController1,
  child: ListView.builder(
    controller: scrollController1,
    itemCount: 100,
    itemBuilder:(context, index) => Center(child: DraggableBlock(index: index)),
  ),
)
```

## More info
launch.json as been configured to run the ./example/lib/main.dart.
